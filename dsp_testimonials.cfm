			"Ezsite has been extremely accommodating to my business.  I had searched over 20 sites looking for one that would meet all of business needs. I am a florist and it was hard for me to find a site that had all of the capabilities that I was looking for.   I needed something that was professional looking with a creative edge. The site is easy to navigate and help is just a click away. If I didn't know something Dominic was more than happy to explain it to me step by step. This kind of customer service is very important to me! Especially since I'm in the service business as well. Again, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SITE!!!"

			"I want to thank you so very much for any help you have given me on this as I have never had or made a Web Site before and with your help I may just make it after all. Thank Your so very much for all the help you have given me so far. As I told you before I have never done this before and am thrilled with all the help I can get from anyone.  Your site is the best site I have been on so far. It is easy to learn what to do and how to do it.  Before I found your site I was lost, I will use you for anyone who joins my program. You have been so helpful and I will not forget you."
